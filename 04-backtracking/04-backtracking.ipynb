These partial candidates are all part of a tree: the potential search tree. Each partial candidate is the parent of some other candidates that only differ from it by a single alteration.

The backtracking algorithm works by traversing the search tree recursively, considering the partial candidates it encounters. At each step, the algorithm checks whether:\n",

    "## Cryptarithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second example, we are going to write a program to solve cryptarithmetic puzzles. A cryptarithmetic problem is a type of puzzle consisting of an equation with unknown numbers whose digits are represented by letters. The equation is typically based on an arithmetic operation, such as addition, multiplication or division. The same letter, the same digit, and a different letter, a different digit. Here is one example of cryptarithmetic puzzle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     P E R E\n",
    "+    N O E L\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "=  J O U E T\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "We are going to solve a reduced version of this problem where the cryptarithmetic puzzle is only composed a two numbers that are added (as above). However, we will have to carefully craft the way we navigative in the search space to avoid some complexity issues. For instance, we are going to assign letters from right to left (in the problem operands). This allows us to prune partial assignments by doing a truncated sum (for example, a partial assignment that assigns `1` to `E`, `2` to `L` and `5` to `T` can be rejected as the above sum requires `E + L == T`)."
