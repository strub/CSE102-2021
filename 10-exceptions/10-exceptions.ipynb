    "# Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will study the Python's exception mechanism. Any running program may be subject to errors for which detection and fallback strategies are possible. These errors are not *necessarily* bugs but exceptional conditions (or **exceptions**) in the normal course of part of a program. For example, the absence of a useful file is not a bug in the program; however, not dealing with its absence would cause one. In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated as users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones. On the other side, the exception mechanism allows you to manage this kind of exceptional conditions during program execution. When an exception occurs, normal program execution is interrupted and the exception is processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exception mechanism relies on two ingredients: exception handlers & exception reporting:\n",
    " - An exception handler establishes a set of error handling routines, defined by the programmer, on a block (in a function or method of the program). These routines are activated for the entire execution time of the protected block. The notion of execution of the protected block includes the whole chain of calls (of functions or methods) from this block: the exception handlers are said to be active within the dynamic range of the block.\n",
    " - When an error condition is detected, it is said to be signaled: an error handling block (a handler) is searched for in the list of active handlers. The execution of the program is deferred to the processing block. Exception reporting can be automatic, if it corresponds to an exception defined in the programming language or a provided library, or it can be triggered by the programmer by using a dedicated primitive. It is possible to construct new types of exceptions. It may be that no handler has been provided by the programmer, in which case a default handler is selected.\n",
    " \n",
    "When you execute Python code in an interpreter such as python3, any exceptions that propagate to the top are then captured by Python itself and transformed into an error message. With no doubt, you have encountered such error messages yourself:"
